While both have their pros and cons, below are some of the reasons why you should leave authorised service stations right now and never go back again.</p>
        <p>A car service, also known as a livery vehicle, is used to refer to a type of vehicle for hire transportation. It differs from yellow cab service in that the term "taxi" is used exclusively to refer to medallion taxis, which may be flagged down on the street on demand. By contrast, car service refers to services which are hired only by appointment over the telephone and dispatched by radio to the driver (taxicabs may also be hired in this way). Car service differs from the more upscale limousine services which are usually reserved for special occasions or business purposes</p>
